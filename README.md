## About The Project  
A modern cross-platform mobile app for personal safety.


### 1.1 Project Description 
Safely is a React Native app designed to help users feel safer when traveling alone or in unfamiliar environments. It works by setting a timer with periodic check-ins. If the user fails to check in before the timer expires, their emergency contact(s) are alerted with their last known details.
 
 * Encourage peace of mind through regular check-ins.
 * Provide automatic alerts to trusted contacts in case of danger or inactivity.
 * Deliver a clean, modern, and intuitive user experience on both iOS and Android.
 * Provide a simple dashboard summary of user's timer data

#### Features include:
* üïí Countdown timer with animated safety waves.
* ‚úÖ Customisable check-in intervals.
* üì≤ SMS/Phone number processing for alerts.
* üîê Firebase-powered authentication and persistence.
* üì° Cloud Firestore for real-time storage of user data.
* ‚ûï Cloud Functions to send SMS alerts

## Getting Started

# 2.1 Prerequisites Ensure you have the following installed before running the app: 

* ![Node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-18+-339933?style=flat-square&logo=nodedotjs&logoColor=white) (v18 or higher)
* ![Expo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Expo_CLI-000020?style=flat-square&logo=expo&logoColor=white) 
* ![Firebase CLI](https://img.shields.io/badge/Firebase_CLI-FFCA28?style=flat-square&logo=firebase&logoColor=black)

> In order to make use of the SMS functionality with Twilio you will need to upgrade to the firestore Blaze Plan and add Cloud Functions to your project

## Features & Usage 
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Custom Safety Timers**: 
Set safety timers for walks, trips, or activities. 
- üì≤ **Check-in Alerts**:
Get reminded to check in when the timer ends. 
- üì© **SMS Alerts via Twilio**: 
If no check-in is received, SMS alerts are sent to emergency contacts. 
- üìä **Dashboard Summary**: 
View logged hours and most-used timers. 
- üîî **Push Notifications**: 
Expo Notifications for reminders and status updates. 
--- 

### **üé® Usage Highlights**  
- **Timer Countdown**:
Users can easily configure a custom safety timer by selecting a duration and confirming the start. The setup screen provides a clean, simple interface with smooth controls, ensuring timers are created quickly and without confusion.

- **Timer Setup**: 
Once a timer is active, the countdown screen displays the remaining time with an animated wave effect that visually ‚Äúdrains down‚Äù as the timer runs. This gives users both a numerical and visual representation of their safety window, making it engaging and intuitive.

## Architecture / System Design 
### System Design Flow 
- Mobile App (React Native, Expo) 
- Firebase Authentication & Firestore 
- Firebase Cloud Functions (Check-in logic + Twilio SMS) 
- Dashboard summary view (aggregated Firestore data)

### UI Designs

## Unit Testing & User Testing 
### ‚úÖ Unit Testing Currently 
**not implemented**
Future plans include Jest + React Native Testing Library for: 
- Timer interactions 
- Dashboard summary data fetch 
- Cloud function triggers (mocked) 

### üë• User Testing conducted informal user feedback rounds targeting: 
- **General Users**: for usability and check-in workflow testing 
- **General Users**: to validate the safety timer concept and dashboard usefulness
